# mdt - markdown tables

`mdt` assists you when working with markdown tables.

It can:

- Parse markdown tables data and column alignments.
- Output markdown tables.

You can use it as a library in your own applications as well as the ready made
CLI under `cmd/mdt` whose documentation can be found there as well.

## Installing

`mdt` is a small package and using it should be easy. Use `go get` to install
the latest version of the library. This will download the library along with the
`mdt` executable:

```
go get -u github.com/n9v9/mdt
```

## CLI

The description of the CLI can be found [here](cmd/mdt).
